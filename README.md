# Fetch Take Home Exercise

Some quick notes on this exercise:
- I tried to use CSS consistent with that found on the main website.
- I kept the structure simple: one HTML file, one CSS file, one JS file and did not put them in separate folders which I would have for a bigger project.
- I have never actually had to send data with a POST request in any of my projects so I'm sure there is improvement to be done there. I wasn't able to get a 200 response, but did log the data as a JSON object and see it sent in the regular POST method.
- I had fun with this :D
